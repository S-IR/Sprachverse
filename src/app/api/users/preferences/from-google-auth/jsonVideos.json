latter is likewise ignorant. anthony turns to his bookshelf and points to a set of patristic writings as a means to demonstrate that he has been reading the fathers for 25 years, implying that he is not ignorant. however, perry robinson demonstrates that anthony is indeed ignorant. it's not just a perceived accusation. he demonstrates that any such accusation bears fruit such that anthony might as well just claim the appellation himself. hence, the clip begins where it does in order to reflect where anthony truly stands with respect to knowledge of the fathers. context is important, right?

having been disappointed for months now, even before the recent allegations which just made them that much worse in my eyes. but at the end of the  wow and blizzard used to be things that i treasured. now it's just honestly pretty depressing to see what it has all become. \nas a creator, this also impacts me. since the less i feel connected to the game i'm making content on, the harder it is to get inspired to make it or to have the motivation to come up with creative ideas. i could honestly go on about this topic for  and already have many, many, many . i'm just kind of tired.\nit never really gets better. for the longest time i've held on to hope as hard as i could, believing they'll turn it around and it'll all be okay again. but that never really happens anymore and at some point you

The Dark Truth Behind Making MILLIONS from Online Courses.","description":"you've seen them everywhere. \n\non the 3rd of september 2015, tai lopez released his infamous ‚Äòhere in my garage‚Äô  ad.\n\nthis single ad created a wave of what some have described as fake gurus, selling you their courses and  programs  no tomorrow with promises of ‚Äòfinancial freedom‚Äô, ‚Äòa laptop lifestyle‚Äô, and the possibility to ‚Äò around the world‚Äô. sounds great, right? \n\nin this  i break down the business model of how to make millions from online courses using the methods that these fake gurus use, and expose the dark truth behind this rapidly growing industry.\n\ndisclaimer: look, i think online courses are brilliant. they helped me edit this , learn about marketing, personal finance etc. but none of these courses promised me ‚Äòfinancial freedom‚Äô, or a ‚Äòlaptop lifestyle'. these courses had set a clear expectation, and i received a clear result.\n\n******\n‚ñ∫  become a patron for

choice. preferably it‚Äôs a fad, and something that could be promoted under the categories of wealth, or , or anything that allows you to target people‚Äôs dreams.\n\nhere are some of the most common niches used by a few well-known gurus‚Ä¶\nkevin david - amazon fba, dropshipping.\ndan lok ‚Äì sales.\njohn crestani ‚Äì  marketing.\niman gadzhi ‚Äì digital marketing agency (otherwise called an smma

cases the ideal route is to pick a niche, start a business in your niche and get a little success, then create your own online  ‚Äì because after all, that‚Äôs where the real money is made. \n\nif you don‚Äôt have any expertise, you can always hire an outside expert to give you a helping hand.\n\nyou see, the  isn‚Äôt what matters the most here, what matters the most is your online marketing for the .\n\nstep 3 ‚Äì market your \nthis is the most important part of this business model. without marketing your online  properly, you won‚Äôt be able to make a lot of money from it.\n\nstart by running some advertisements on , ,  etc, and begin by selling them a dream. tell your audience that you were also broke and in debt, but after starting [insert niche here] you began making six figures, millions, travelling around the world, became financially , have a laptop lifestyle, etc‚Ä¶ \n\ntell them to join your  training ‚Äì where your main goal isn‚Äôt to teach them anything, but to get them to ask more questions. remind them of their dreams, remind them of your backstory, and finally go in for the hard sell where you create scarcity and a sense of urgency in order to get them to  your ridiculously priced  right now.\n\nstep 4 ‚Äì profit.\nwith the right marketing, you should now be seeing some of that sweet, sweet profit fly in from your online courses. \n\nbut why stop there? the real way to make millions from online courses is to create an entire ladder of products. you want to upsell your ‚Äòstudents‚Äô as much as possible. get your ‚Äòstudents‚Äô hooked on your products.\n\nyou never tell them the truth: the reason you‚Äôre so rich, is because of all the products you‚Äôve sold them. not because of your dropshipping or amazon fba business. \n\nbacklash against fake gurus\nthankfully, there has been a rise in backlash against these so-called fake gurus. thanks to channels  coffeezilla (otherwise known as coffee break), mike winnet, and spencer

Let Go | The Philosophy of Fight Club","description":" is short. it‚Äôs ending  minute at a time. why waste it on fulfilling other people‚Äôs expectations? this is just  of those questions presented in a novel written by chuck palahniuk named fight club.\n\nthe film version of fight club directed by david fincher, starring brad pitt, edward norton, and helena bonham carter, could be considered  of the best and most impactful  ever made when looking at its reception and ongoing popularity.\n\nfight club isn‚Äôt shy of over-the-top violence, contains a fair amount of explicit language, and, of , the obnoxious behavior of its characters. however, it‚Äôs definitely more profound than just men coming together to beat each other up.\n\nthe story is built on several thoughtful concepts that are interesting and possibly applicable to our own lives. \n\nit tells a story about a generation of people without a clear purpose, without hope, raised with false expectations, and repressed by ever-tightening social norms. what if our existence is pointless? what if god doesn‚Äôt  us? what if we‚Äôre nothing more than a compost heap? how do we find meaning in a meaningless existence?\n\nthis  explores several philosophical ideas that fight club presents us. for those who aren‚Äôt familiar with the story: this analysis explains and reveals the plot.\n\n the :\nÔ∏è

attempting to debunk orthodox ecclesiology. as you will see in the , the \"trailer-ites\"/\"trailer-trads\" stated numerous falsehoods, which can only be assumed to be lies or based in ignorance. we are not sure which is worse given their pontification on the topic - which is ironic since they do not have a pontiff.\n\nthis  discusses the criteria by which the orthodox church determines what is and is not an ecumenical council as well as the council of florence and why robert and frederick dimond are deceivers and pseudo-monks, whom the canons of numerous local and ecumenical councils warn against.\n\nfurthermore, we extend a debate challenge to the dimond brothers and any of their followers to come onto our  and debate the topic. \n\nwe thank @jaydyer for his continued  as well as all

so what should you do with all this money?\n\nwhat you shouldn‚Äôt do is use it to lower tuition prices bc we gotta keep milking this house of cards for everything it's got! what you should do is hoard the cash - and start a hedge fund! but the problem is, if we call it a hedge fund, it would make us sound too greedy, too money hungry! so let‚Äôs call it an endowment! \n\n‚Äúbut jake, we‚Äôre in this too deep, we need student loans, schools should get tax benefits bc they‚Äôre educating our youth, endowments are important‚Äù. when you  almost any product - if it doesn‚Äôt deliver what it promised, you get a refund. so if the promise of a degree is that it‚Äô equals success in the world, why don‚Äôt colleges and universities offer a money back guarantee if you don‚Äôt get a job?\n\nnow they say that ‚Äúeven though it's our fault that college is this expensive, this time it‚Äôs different - we‚Äôre just gonna give you  college. so vote for me, please!‚Äù i am not a fan of arbitrary student debt relief. i think a step in the right direction would be to let students declare bankruptcy just  any other debt.\n\nso why is the college racket possibly ‚Äôs greatest scam?

school. he explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental  and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. dr. palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in alzheimer‚Äôs. he describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental , how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental . he also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial  such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. we also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. dr. palmer‚Äôs work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental  and disease that, given the prevalence of mental  challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.\n\nthank you to our sponsors\nag1 (athletic greens):

mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions  the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. i also provide science-based stretching and ‚Äúmicro-stretching‚Äù protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. i  all the details of those stretching

performance with andy galpin, phd, professor of kinesiology at california state university, fullerton. he explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. he also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. he also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. we cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic . aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. this episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite

visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. i also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. i also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. finally, i explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to  all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. this episode ought to be useful for

(llms) by generalizing the concept of chain-of-thought prompting and introduces a tree search across language model thoughts, including state evaluation and backtracking. experiments on toy tasks show large improvements over both classic and chain-of-thought prompting.\n\noutline:\n0:00 - introduction\n1:20 - from chain-of-thought to tree-of-thought\n11:10 - formalizing the algorithm\n16:00 - game

models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. this means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. to surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, tree of thoughts (tot), which generalizes over the popular chain of thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. tot allows lms to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next  of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. our experiments show that tot significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: game of 24, creative writing, and mini crosswords. for instance, in game of 24, while gpt-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%. code repo with all prompts: this  url.\n\nauthors: shunyu yao, dian yu, jeffrey zhao, izhak shafran, thomas l. griffiths, yuan cao,

networks. we  equivalent trees of some neural networks and show that besides providing interpretability, tree representation can also achieve some computational advantages. the analysis holds both for fully connected and convolutional networks, which may or may not also include skip connections and/or normalizations.\n\nauthor: caglar aytekin\n\n:\nhomepage: ://ykilcher.\nmerch:

these words may be difficult to hear; they are written by the greatest missionary to america of our . let us take heed to stand firm on the teachings of our holy elder ephraim lest we fall away from the narrow path.\n\n---please  the fundraiser and purchase you copy of ‚Äúsent by god: the  of geronda ephraim‚Äù: ://www.indiegogo./projects/sent-by-god-the--of-geronda-ephraim#/\n\n\n‚Äúchrist's church is catholic in the sense that it possesses the entire fullness of the truth and the grace to illuminate and redeem the world; it is, moreover, catholic in the sense that it tends not to conquer but to sanctify the world. the head of the church is christ and we are members of it connected by the common faith in conjunction with love.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúthe  of the church is the story of its struggle to sanctify its faithful.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶mere knowledge of things divine cannot save us; it is the taste, indeed, the experience of a  in christ that will do so. and this is so because christian truth is not an intellectual affair but a living experience of the dogmatic and moral doctrines of the faith and a mysterious and mystic communication between the faithful and its founder.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúin cases of deliberate or undeliberate deviation from tradition, judgement has always been, is and shall be pronounced by the sound public  of the church which by right intervenes and restores peace in the church; peace not truth, for the grace and the truth never abandon the divine body of the church. it abandons those who in wavering ‚Äòconcerning faith have made shipwreck, and betray the birthright of the common heritage of those ‚Äòtaxed‚Äô in the heavens.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúsatan did his best to snatch away countless men from the bosom of the church and to present it before the world as being divided and weak. now he is again doing his best to unite it into a peculiar union of his own inspiration, using as leaven the formula of ‚Äòlove.‚Äô such has been the plethoric use and abuse of this ‚Äòlove‚Äô by so many that others neither wish to hear nor talk about love.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúthe rule is that where much is being said about a virtue, that virtue is not to be found there. the voice raised in favor of that virtue is the cry of its absence. this is the case with the ‚Äòlove‚Äô of all those who believe that they should contribute towards the realization of the lord's wish ‚Äòthat they all may be .‚Äô let us be more specific. they say that we orthodox should unite with the roman catholics and then with the protestants and with all the known and unknown heresies conceived by the devil in the name of christianity. after all christians without exception unite, they should then unite with the mohammedans, the jews, and in extension with the buddhists, brahmins, shintoists and with all the religions of the universe in general. this pan-heretical alchemy is being inspired through the so-called world council of churches. we think that the term is not true to the fact, for it does not concern a world council of churches but a world council of will worship.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúthe strong position taken up by father george florovsky that ‚Äòorthodoxy's mission is to be a martyr and ‚Äòbear witness unto the truth'‚Äô may be fulfilled only with an orthodox ecumenism described by father spyridon bilialis in his book, orthodoxy and papism. ‚Äòwe believe that it is high time that the orthodox church came forth united before the world and promoted its own orthodox ecumenism by setting up purely orthodox ecumenical rostrums where from in loud voices it would proclaim 'urbi et orbi' that orthodoxy alone is today the , holy, catholic and apostolic church of christ.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n‚Äúwe feel no animosity against any men because of their heresy or their faithlessness, but we shall never come to love faithlessness or heresy for the sake of men, because if we do we shall be alienated from god.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúchristianity is the soul, the  and the hope of the world.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúthere have always been laymen with hearts of monks; and there have always been monks with hearts of laymen. it is not the place but the means that makes the man. repentance, my brethren and fathers in christ, as saint

falling asleep of  of the most blessed and saintly americans: hieromonk seraphim of platina. memory eternal! holy father seraphim, pray to god for us!\n\nfrom chapter 86 of the biography by hieromonk damascene, ‚Äúfather seraphim rose: his  and works‚Äù:\n\nhe never changed his basic, original philosophy; he was no closer to becoming an ecumenist, modernist, or a new calendarist at the end of his  than he had been when he had  started printing the orthodox word. it was just that now, especially after witnessing the bitter fruits of ‚Äúcorrectness disease‚Äù in the church, he saw that there was something much more essential that he should be preaching in these last , when ‚Äúthe love of many grows cold.‚Äù above all, fr. seraphim became a preacher of orthodoxy of the heart. besides the resurrection of holy russia (of which more will be said later), this was his main theme during the last part of his .\n\n‚Äúst. tikhon, therefore, gives us a start in understanding what orthodoxy is: it is something  of all of the heart, not just the mind, something living and warm, not abstract and cold, something that is learned and practiced in , not just in school.‚Äù\n\nin preaching inward orthodoxy of the heart, fr. seraphim warned against being calculating and critical. he identified this as the temptation of following ‚Äúexternal wisdom.‚Äù ‚Äúsometimes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äú‚Äôs zeal for ‚Äòorthodoxy‚Äô (in quotes) can be so excessive that it produces a situation similar to that which caused an old russian woman to remark about an enthusiastic american convert: ‚Äòwell, he‚Äôs certainly orthodox, all right‚Äîbut is he a christian?‚Äô to be ‚Äòorthodox but not christian‚Äô is a state that has a particular name in christian language: it means to be a pharisee, to be so bogged down in the letter of the church‚Äôs laws that  loses the spirit that gives them , the spirit of true christianity.‚Äù\n\nfr. herman recalls how, when he and fr. seraphim were  honoring the memory of fr. gerasim in the orthodox word in the early 1970s, he had expressed his reservations to his co-laborer. ‚Äúhow can we present fr. gerasim as a modern giant of traditional orthodoxy,‚Äù fr. herman asked, ‚Äúwhen he had those nineteenth-century western-style icons in his church?‚Äù\n‚Äúthose very icons,‚Äù fr. seraphim replied, ‚Äùprove that he was in the tradition, because he accepted simply and lovingly what was handed down to him from his righteous fathers in the faith.‚Äù\n\nfr. seraphim also observed how we can be following ‚Äúexternal wisdom‚Äù when we get caught up in exalted ideas: ‚Äúit is the  now to learn about the jesus prayer, to read the philokalia, to go ‚Äòback to the fathers.‚Äô these kinds of things also will not save us‚Äîthey are external. they may be helpful if they are used rightly, but if they become your passion, the  thing you are after, then they become externals which lead not to christ, but to antichrist.‚Äù\n\neven though monastics have a greater responsibility to pray for the world because of their greater opportunity, fr. seraphim made clear that this duty is common to all christians. in his talks he counseled monastics and laypeople alike to go throughout the world in their minds, praying for those who were struggling and suffering. he especially asked them to pray for christians who were being persecuted for their faith.\n\nfr. seraphim‚Äôs love for others, expressed in his outward deeds and in his inward prayer, was both the means and the evidence of his going deeper into the orthodox christian faith. as our lord jesus christ has said, by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples: if ye have love  to another (john 13:35). fr. seraphim had truly been granted the prayer he had brought before the mother of god in 1961, when he had asked her to let him enter ‚Äúthe heart of hearts‚Äù of the saving faith of christ. at the heart of true christianity, he had found that on which hang all the law and the prophets (matt. 22:40): love for god, and love for ‚Äôs neighbor. it was the  and  commandment of the incarnate god‚Äîof him who made of love a law.\n\nread the full biography here:\n\nthe original biography:

frequently neglected saying of christ. his peace is not the peace of the world, his truth both unites and divides. as he said to his disciples after his tough sayings led many to leave him: ‚Äúdo you also want to go away?‚Äù let us respond  the apostle peter, ‚Äúlord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal .‚Äù\n\n\narchbishop averky: ‚Äúall of these frequent, unnaturally flowery speeches, and until now, hysterical cries about peace for the world are for the most part from people who are either far from true christianity or openly hostile towards the church. these speeches come from people who themselves do not live in peace with god and their consciences. their relations with their neighbors are filled with malice. can we believe the sincerity of the words pronounced by people who reject faith in god and love for their neighbor, and do not recognize the voice of conscience? can we believe that those who audaciously and arrogantly blaspheme, declaring war on god himself and his holy church, are truly striving for peace? these are the same people who not long ago did not conceal the fact that their plan was \"to kindle a worldwide fire\" [communism], and who openly preached \"class hatred\" as the basis for their ideology. they are not at all troubled over shedding rivers of blood and exterminating millions of people simply on the suspicion that they may not be in agreement with their ideology. can we truly believe the sincerity of peace lovers who speak sweetly of \"christian love\" and \"universal forgiveness,\" yet at the same time sow conflict and dissension, spreading lies and slander which incite enmity and division, setting people against  another.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúsurely  understands that when our lord jesus christ said, resist not evil (matt. 5:39) he was only replacing the previous old testament law of personal revenge, forbidding us to take revenge on those who personally offend us. there is no way that  should understand this saying to refer to no resistance to evil in general, as leo tolstoy and his followers understood it. on the contrary, our lord taught very clearly that his true followers must be completely uncompromising towards evil, even in those most difficult circumstances which involve our conscience, in those circumstances where evil becomes incarnate in people close and dear to us. let us recall for example the following words of our savior which so disturb those who view christian love as something sweet, sentimental, nice: if any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own  also, he cannot be my disciple (luke 14:26).‚Äù\n\n‚Äúst. gregory the theologian taught, \"the greatest good is peace, it is beautiful in both word and deed. peace is of god (phil. 4:7), god is peace (ii cor. 13:11), and god is called peace (eph. 2:14)\" (works of st. gregory, homily 23, vol.il, p. 186). he continues, \"at the same time we must not value just any peace. for disagreement can appear pleasant, and some types of unity are very ruinous.  should love only a good peace which has a good goal and unites with god...when it is clear that what is at hand is impious or dishonest, then it is better to go into the fire, the sword, and not go along with the demands of the  and rulers, rather than become a participant in an evil leaven and part of an infection. there is nothing worse than to fear something more than god, and over this fear become instead of a servant of truth, a traitor to the teaching of truth and faith' (works of st.

search of the truth, which he ultimately realized is a person: the lord jesus christ, whose body is the holy orthodox church. he had been previously inspired by thomas merton and his pursuit of the other world, and with pain of heart wrote a letter expressing his concerns, concerns which were later justified by merton‚Äôs ultimate abandonment of not only prayerful, ascetic christianity, but of the uniqueness of christian truth altogether.\n\nthe ideas set forth in this letter were written at the same time eugene was writing his desired magnum opus, the kingdom of man and the kingdom of god,

christianity can be outwardly \"successful\" in the world is a denial of all that christ and his prophets have said of the future of the church. christianity can be \"successful\" on  condition: that of renouncing (or conveniently forgetting) the true kingdom and seeking to build up a kingdom in the world. the \"earthly kingdom\" is precisely the goal of the modern mentality; the building of it is the meaning of the modern age. it is not christian; as christians, we know whose kingdom it is. and what so greatly troubles me is that today christians‚Äîcatholic and orthodox alike‚Äîare themselves joining, often quite unaware of the fact, often with the best possible intentions, in the building of this new babel....‚Äù\n\n‚Äúwhen i feed my hungry brother, this is a christian act and a preaching of the kingdom that needs no words; it is done for the personal reason that my brother‚Äîhe who stands before me at this moment‚Äîis hungry, and it is a christian act because my brother is, in some sense, christ. but if i generalize from this case and embark on a political crusade to abolish the \"evil of hunger,\" that is something entirely different; though individuals who participate in such a crusade may act in a perfectly christian way, the whole project‚Äîand precisely because it is a \"project,\" a thing of human planning‚Äîhas become wrapped in a kind of cloak of ‚Äúidealism.‚Äù‚Äù\n\n‚Äúwhat is needed is not more busyness but a deeper penetration within. not less fasting, but more; not more action, but prayer and penance‚Ä¶if christians in their daily  were really on fire with love of god and zeal for his kingdom not of this world‚Äîthen everything else needful would  of itself.‚Äù\n\n‚Äúthe political union of mankind, however legitimate it may be as a political goal, can only end in the reign of antichrist; the church, beyond all doubt, will be crucified after a good many of the faithful have betrayed her through the deceptions of the antichrist. i

not just monks in name and outward appearance, but also inwardly. according to the watchful fathers,  is not called a monk if he does not have this hidden work within him. therefore, we too must compel ourselves to pray for our soul to be full of benefit. only then can we consider ourselves to be monks. just as someone could wonder how a body could live without a soul, likewise a person experienced in prayer would be at a loss and say, \"but how can people live without this spiritual nourishment!\"\n\nour passions of soul and body are remedied in proportion to the progress we have made in prayer and the benefit we have received from it. the healing of 's passions and weaknesses marks how much a person has advanced in prayer.\n\nconsequently, we must compel ourselves. we must constantly urge ourselves not to forget the prayer, not to neglect it. when we notice that the prayer has \"sprung a leak,\" has weakened and begins to waver and stumble, it is necessary as quickly as possible to strive to correct it, to work with diligence, to restore strength to our prayer. how will this be accomplished? the soul must collect itself immediately, must concentrate, \"tighten the belt,‚Äù as we say, and vigorously begin to pray. it must drive away thoughts, expel worries,  the mind from distraction and say, ‚Äúi will occupy myself with the prayer now.\" and when we occupy ourselves with it in this way for a while, we shall soon feel the power which proceeds from diligence in prayer.\n\nin conclusion, there is nothing left for us to do except to compel ourselves; to compel ourselves constantly. we should occupy ourselves with prayer above all, saying continuously: \"lord jesus christ, have mercy on me.\" as we wake up in the morning we should say the prayer; then, we should do our work with the name of christ on our lips.\n_______\n\northodox wisdom is dedicated to sharing the writings and lives of the saints of the orthodox church. glory to jesus christ!","publishedAt":"2023-05-03T13:46:21.000Z","title":"On Watchfulness and Noetic Prayer - Elder Ephraim of Arizona","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCHoWUkGQPpFpxVvWcfVXzSQ","videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Orthodox Wisdom","liked":false},"7A0_Vw--4LU":{"description":"st. sophrony is  of the greatest saints of the 20th century, a teacher of prayer of the heart and  graced with the experience of the uncreated light. he was glorified as a saint in 2019 and is beloved by the entire church worldwide.\n\nthis excerpt comes from letter 11, dec 3/16, 1932 found in \"striving for knowledge of god: correspondence with david balfour\" available for sale here: ://essexmonastery./bookshop/striving-for-knowledge-of-god/\n\nst. sophrony writes:\n\n\"...i would  to say a little about the fact that at the present time a significant part of the christian world tends to accept  of the most dangerous heresies. what is consists of is people saying that in our  there is not  church which has kept fully the true teaching of christ;

today, living in such complicated , we have to be not merely ready, but triply ready, at the minimum! possibly we may meet not only with sudden death, but with other dangers. so let‚Äôs drive away the desire to arrange our lives comfortably! may love of honor and the spirit of self-sacrifice live in us.\n\ni see that something is in the works, that something lies just around the corner, but it‚Äôs constantly being put off. little delays all the time. who‚Äôs creating the delays? god? another month passes, then another couple of months!\n\nthat‚Äôs the main thing: for true brotherly love to exist between us. kindness, love ‚Äî that‚Äôs strength! \n\ndeath in battle adds greatly to god‚Äôs mercy, for a person who dies the death of the brave sacrifices himself to defend others. those who give up their lives out of pure love in order to defend their neighbor are imitating christ. these people are supreme heroes. they arouse fear in our enemies. death herself trembles before them, because they scorn her due to their great love, and attain immortality in this , finding the key to eternity under the gravestone. they enter into eternal blessedness without difficulty.\n\nthat‚Äôs why i say to you: cultivate self-sacrifice, brotherly love. may each of you attain a spiritual condition which will allow you to get out of difficult situations. without a spiritual condition a person loses courage, because he loves himself. he can renounce christ, betray him.\n\nthere is no spiritual  without sacrifice. try to remember, at least a little bit, that death exists. and since we‚Äôll die in any case, let‚Äôs not take care of ourselves too much. look after your , but not to the degree where you begin to bow down before your peace and well-being. i‚Äôm not asking anyone to throw themselves headlong into dangerous adventures, but you have to have at least a bit of heroism, my brother!\n\nin order to succeed at anything  needs a wild streak, in the positive sense. he who lacks this wild streak can become neither a hero nor a saint. the heart must become uncalculating.\n\nfear is necessary when it helps a person turn to god. fear from lack of faith, from lack of trust in god, on the other hand, is ruinous. such fear is driven out by audacity. we must remember: the more a person fears, the more he is tempted by the enemy. if a person refuses to strive to become courageous, and doesn‚Äôt strive for real love, then when a difficult situation arises he‚Äôll become a laughingstock.\n_______\n\northodox wisdom is dedicated to sharing the writings and lives of the saints of the orthodox church. glory to jesus christ!","publishedAt":"2023-04-11T16:43:11.000Z","title":"There is No Spiritual Life Without Sacrifice - St. Paisios the Athonite","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCHoWUkGQPpFpxVvWcfVXzSQ","videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Orthodox Wisdom","liked":false},"BZOCmpJjJcg":{"description":"elder athanasios mitilinaios, a dynamic and beloved preacher, abbot of the monastery of komnineiou and saint john the theologian in stomion, larisa, greece, gave 104 consecutive lessons of revelation to thousands of faithful. this beloved elder, venerated by many in greece and around the world, reposed in the lord in the year 2006. \n\nthis homily is recorded with the blessing of constantine zalalas, translator of ‚Äúrevelation: the seven golden lampstands‚Äù by archimandrite athanasios mitilinaios.\n\npurchase this volume, as well as volume ii to v here: ://www.zoepress.us\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nnew lecture  at orthodox ethos: \nthe revelation of jesus christ to the apostle & evangelist john the theologian ( 1)\n\nthis lecture  will be presented under the tutelage of the teachings of elder athanasios mitilinaios, walking line by line through the book of revelation\n\nvia : ://youtu.be/hpholrcbh1q\n\nlesson 1: january 11th: introduction: an ecclesiastical book\n\nwhen: the  begins on tuesday, january 11th at 8 pm est (5 pm pst); lectures will be held every other tuesday, with question and answer sessions held every thursday at 8 pm est through the orthodox ethos patreon page (patreon./frpeterheers)\n\nwhere: lectures will be live-streamed simultaneously through: \n: ://www../orthodoxethos\n: ://www../frpeterheers \n: ://./orthodoxethos \ncrowdcast: ://www.crowdcast.io/theorthodoxe...\n\nwho: the  will be presented by archpriest peter heers, lecturer, holy trinity orthodox seminary\n\nhow: to attend the * and the question answer sessions visit the orthodox ethos patreon page - www.patreon./frpeterheers.\nlecture  and dates [ ]: \n\nmeets: tuesday evenings, 8 pm est, 5 pm pst, 12 am (wed.)

app to track the calories and macros in the foods you‚Äôre eating. here are a few apps i recommend (not sponsored):\n\n- myfitnesspal: ://www.myfitnesspal./\n- fitgenie: ://www.fitgenieapp./\n- carbon diet coach: ://joincarbon./\n\ngenerally, i recommend this approach more for beginners who might not be able to easily estimate the nutritional content of the foods they're eating.\n\n2. a  option would be a more auto-regulated approach, where, if you already have a reasonably high nutritional competence, you can use techniques  mindful eating (paying attention and eating more slowly rather than being distracted), appetite monitoring (staying in the mid-zone of a 1-10 satiety scale ‚Äì not being too hungry or too full), increasing a daily step count (which will help regulate satiety better) and choosing satiating foods (lots of fruits and vegetables with your meals and drink plenty of water). these techniques can help you establish a caloric deficit without having to track everything you eat.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nhelp  the  by:\n\n1. trying  of my training programs: ‚Üí \n\n2. checking out what my sponsors have to offer:\n\n‚ñπ mass (monthly research

\n\n-------------------------------\n\nwhen it comes to the bench press, there are 4 things you can start doing right away that will have an immediate impact on your max strength.\n\nstep 1: fix your bar path (the path the bar takes when viewed from the side). \n\nto maximize strength on the bench press you should be pressing the bar back toward your face and then up, not just straight up. this back and up technique will also strengthen the pecs more, since it emphasizes horizontal shoulder adduction over shoulder flexion at the toughest points in the press. \n\ndata from dr. thomas mclaughlin found that while most benchers did correctly bring the bar down and slightly forward in a smooth arc on the descent, only elite level benchers drove the bar back and then up, whereas novice lifters tended to press the bar straight up , and then slightly back. \n\nputting this into practice, i‚Äôd recommend filming your sets from the side to get a close look at your bar path‚Ä¶ you can use an app  iron path or dartfish to track this easily. if you‚Äôre pressing the bar straight up, make a conscious effort to press the bar back , and then up. this might feel a bit awkward at . you want to get to a point where it feels natural. i cue this by thinking about pushing the floor away from me while i simultaneously drive the bar back and up off my chest.\n\nstep #2: grip the bar wider\n\nwherever you‚Äôre currently gripping the bar, try gradually easing your grip out by about 1 finger‚Äôs width every  over the next few weeks. most of the world‚Äôs top benchers press with a max legal grip width, with the index fingers all the way out to the grip rings, although this may not be comfortable for everyone. \n\ntip #3: bench press more often\n\nthe next step is to simply bench press more frequently. i think that benching 3  per week will be the sweet spot for most people. for example, running with a set up  this, we would focus on hypertrophy on  1 with sets of 8 reps, power on  two with lighter speed work, and then strength work on  3, with heavy sets of 5.\n\nmonday: bench 1 x 2 (rpe9), 2 x 8 (rpe7)\nwednesday: bench 4 x 3 (rpe6) (press the bar explosively off the chest)\nfriday: pause bench 3 x 5 (2- pause) (rpe8)\n\nstep 4: add heavy top sets before volume work \n\ntop sets are a great way to get comfortable with lifting heavy weight on a regular basis which will improve confidence in your ability to lift heavier without frying your recovery. i‚Äôd recommending adding  heavy top set somewhere around 90 percent of your 1 rep max for 2 to 3 reps before backing off and doing your main work for that . you only need to do this once a week, ideally before your lightest lifting . \n\n-------------------------------\n\n me on :\n\n ‚Ä£ \n ‚Ä£ \n

is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees who are in need of something new to drive continued progress. this is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5  a week). full body training has several advantages including:\n\n- reduced soreness = better performance\n- improved recovery capacity = more progress\n- improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus\n- high quality volumes = better muscle growth\n\nalso includes:\n\n- exact sets, reps, exercises, rest time, rpe targets\n- exercise substitutions\n-   for every exercise\n- full summaries of volume for every bodypart\n- ‚Äúprogram explained‚Äù section\n- a full faq‚Äôs section\n- 39 scientific references\n\nget it here:

research  ( link)\n\n\nweightology research  ( link)\n\n\nalan aragon's research  (aarr)\n://alanaragon./aarr/\n\nexamine. erd\n://examine./store/erd/\n\n-------------------------------\n\nthe  mistake occurs when people focus far too much on the little details. this is when people focus on minutia not driving progress which can distract from the things that really matter. examples of this include organic  conventional foods, the glycemic index and meal timing. total daily caloric intake and total daily protein intake will determine the majority of results when it comes to fat loss or muscle gain, so these smaller factors should be built around these main principles, not the other way around.\n\nthe  mistake is when people think in \"good or bad\" terms. this is so common in the mainstream media where you see the target shifting from fats being bad, to carbs being bad, to carbs being ok, but sugar is bad, whereas in reality, there are so many shades of grey to these blanket statements. \n\nmistake number three is making sudden, drastic changes to your diet. this is really common in the new year when motivation is high and people want results right away. but rather than cutting by crash dieting, a more gradual rate of weight loss will help prevent muscle loss. when bulking, a slower approach will also prevent unwanted fat gain. \n\nmistake number four is relying on nutrition documentaries as a legitimate source of information. this includes the game changers, supersize me, what the , and pretty much any other popular  you can suggest. they‚Äôre generally created by producers that already have an idea in mind that they then try to prove to you.\n\nthe final mistake is focusing too much on supplements. as a beginner, i think the only supplement i‚Äôd strongly recommend is whey protein powder, using creatine and caffeine optionally to give you an extra edge. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nhelp  the  by:\n\n1. trying  of my training programs: ‚Üí

are better for bulking\n\nboth of these ideas aren‚Äôt really true. what people mean by ‚Äútoning‚Äù is basically losing fat so the underlying muscle can show through better. according to the best research we have, losing fat is just a matter of putting yourself in a caloric deficit and eating enough protein. there are at least 3 studies showing that bodyfat spot reduction isn‚Äôt possible and a typical weight lifting session only burns about 75-300 calories anyway. still, i think there is a practical hypertrophy zone somewhere around 6-15 reps.\n\ntraining myth 2: you should only train  bodypart per  (bodypart split)\n\nresearch shows that a full week between workouts is way more time than you need and there might be a ‚Äúlimit‚Äù to how much you can benefit from killing  muscle in  .the ‚Äúbest‚Äù training split is the  that allows you to get an in adequate amount of volume per week, while distributing your working sets throughout the week in a way that maximizes performance and recovery.\n\ntraining myth 3: need to get sore for the  to ‚Äúcount‚Äù\n\nsoreness is a result of a novel stimulus, not necessarily an effective stimulus. soreness can be a decent indicator that you actually hit the muscle you were trying to hit. did you lift more weight this  than the last ? did you do more reps than the previous ? did you improve your form in some small way? these metrics are far more valuable than how much your muscles hurt the next . \n\ntraining myth 4: muscle confusion is important: always switch things up\n\nfor beginners, i recommend the exact opposite approach: you want to keep the core of your training routine exactly the same week to week. you can have some exercises that you‚Äôre more flexible with and you can swap those in and out, but aim to at least have 1 or two ‚Äúmain movements‚Äù per  that you stick to, get better at, and get stronger with. \n\ntraining myth 5: no pain no gain! take every set to failure!\n\nsince taking sets to failure, especially on heavy compound exercises can cause more fatigue, increase injury risk through form breakdown and reduce the volume later in the , i generally recommend reserving sets taken to failure for the last set of an isolation exercise, while leaving 1 to 3 reps in the tank for everything else. \n\n-------------------------------\n\n me on :\n\n ‚Ä£ \n ‚Ä£ \n ‚Ä£ \npodcast ‚Ä£ the jeff nippard podcast on

are 4 things you can start doing right away that will have an immediate impact on your max strength.\n\n let's cover basic chest prioritization :\n\n: hit chest earlier in the .\n: tally up roughly how many sets of chest you‚Äôre hitting per week right now. once you‚Äôve got the proper techniques handled, then you can start adding  or two sets per week over the next month or two as you assess your progress, working your way up through the 12-20 set ‚Äúoptimal zone‚Äù. \n: increase frequency. if you‚Äôre currently only hitting your chest once per week on monday, start hitting it twice per week.\n\nstep 1: modify your bench press technique\n\nthe  modification is to use slightly lighter weights for higher reps. the  way we want to modify our bench technique is by bringing our grip slightly in. even though you won‚Äôt be able to move as much weight this way, if you‚Äôre more concerned with developing your upper chest, a closer grip will likely hit the upper fibers better.\n\nstep 2: add more incline presses\n\nthe reason i‚Äôm using dumbbells over barbells here is that you will be able to get a bit more range of motion with the extra stretch at the bottom: so the short comings of the barbell press are overcome by also including dumbbells. a cue i  to use on the incline press to drive upper chest focus is to keep the elbows moderately tucked and think about pressing the dumbbells up and back toward your face, rather than just straight up.\n\nstep 3: incorporate more non-traditional exercises\n\nthe reverse grip bench press, band press and banded push-ups are the three movements we can consider including. i‚Äôm personally a bit more wary of the guillotine press as it just feels too risky to me, so i‚Äôd stick with the banded push up and the banded incline press for higher reps in the 15-20 range to see if you feel them working your upper chest.\n\nstep 4: fill in further volume with isolation work\n\ni  low to high cable flyes. while dumbbell flyes can be effective for really stretching out the pecs at the bottom, they lose tension at the top. when pulling the cables from low to high, you can mimic the exact orientation of the clavicular fibers, which also run low to high. you might feel this in your front delts (and that‚Äôs ok) but if you really focus on the mind-muscle connection and actively squeezing your pecs together, you should feel your upper pecs contracting the most. \n\n-------------------------------\n\n me on :\n\n ‚Ä£ \n ‚Ä£ \n ‚Ä£ \npodcast ‚Ä£ the jeff nippard podcast on itunes and

seem to think you can‚Äôt, (or you shouldn‚Äôt) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. but i don‚Äôt quite agree with this. \n\nit‚Äôs common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. \nmost personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. for strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. and while there is some truth to this, it doesn‚Äôt capture the full picture.\n\nthe bottom line is: unless you‚Äôre going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) and light weights (high reps) are both effective at building muscle. however, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. \n\nin this  i will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nsources:\n\nmass volume 2, issue 5

make an effort to vary our body positions throughout the . \n\n2. if you fix your posture, you will fix your pain. in reality, the link between posture and pain is not well established in the scientific literature. resistance training, regular cardio/walking and modifying tasks with a physical therapist until pain subsides are some of the better strategies. \n\n3. you can fix poor posture with simple 10 minute daily drills and stretches. in reality, progressive resistance training with a focus on getting stronger is more likely to improve your ability to deal with postural challenges. \n\n4. bad posture is always a problem worth fixing. in reality, people who worry about their posture a lot, tend to experience and catastrophize pain more than those who do not. it simply may not be

transformations.\nnobody does body transformations quite  hollywood.\n\nbut when the cameras and lights go down, what goes on?\nthis  explores the general narrative behind celebrity body transformations, how and why they achieve such rapid results.\nbut more importantly why you should not look to hollywood for your fitness advice.\n\npart 1- the pledge:\nwhat is the ‚Äòideal‚Äô physique and how do you get there?\nit‚Äôs a matter of fact that taking care of your fitness will improve your  drastically,\nbut what is this ‚Äòhollywood physique‚Äô which everyone talks about?\ncommonly referred to as the golden ratio physique, this represents the ‚Äòideal make proportions‚Äô for aesthetic symmetry and while this often takes the most dedicated a century to achieve, actors seem to be getting close, often in less than a year‚Ä¶\nso how do they do it?\n\npart 2- the turn:\nafter reading many magazines, articles and celebrity interviews, how they say they achieved their results warrants respect. with actors such as zac effron blending his chicken and chugging it their dedication is unquestionable.\nbut the diet of only chicken broccoli and rice, 4 hr training sessions and wildly intense training plans just make gaining muscle seem  an impossible process. \nwhile you may get results training  a maniac, this is not the only way!\neven better, its not even close to optimal!\n\npart 3- the prestige:\nso, what is going on behind the scenes in many of these transformations?\nwhile nobody can say for sure, it is extremely likely that they have some extra ‚Äòassistance‚Äô \nwhich allows them to train harder for longer, while gaining above natural levels of muscle.\n\npart 4: signs of ped‚Äôs \nas much as i don‚Äôt want to be that guy calling people out for taking ‚Äòstuff‚Äô, its important to look at some of the signs of ped usage, while 1 or 2 alone is definitely not conclusive, when many coexist together you have the right to get suspicious‚Ä¶\n(its also important to note that many of these celebrities are probably going to be able to avoid most of these side effects with the help of top doctors).\n\npart 5: the consequences \nthis is the part which matters most!\na common misconception is that the people making natty or not  are just jealous haters.\nhowever, i would argue that the frequent exaggeration and lack of transparency of how these transformations are achieved have many consequences:\n- unrealistic body expectations\n- increase in ped usage \n- decrease in mental  (especially if you try to  some of these routines)\n- increase in eating disorders\n- increase in companies profiting off of ambiguity (e.g. snake oil supplements)\n\nconclusion\nwhile hollywood body transformations may inspire millions and have a net positive effect, its important to be aware of the other side of things.\nhollywood is an industry built on illusions and i strongly advise you to get your fitness advice from qualified professionals as opposed to hollywood actors and those speculative magazines (more spews for views).\nmany of these hollywood body transformations are wildly exaggerated and are by no means realistic for your average person, but that should be okay, you can still achieve incredible results, and achieve close to the golden ratio physique naturally, just don‚Äôt go expecting to look  chris

incubate problems which would go on to haunt the brand if left unaddressed....\n---------------------------------------\nthe growth of gymshark has been nothing short of incredible.\nwithout a doubt, they have inspired millions to go to the gym.\nthis seems weird when talking about a clothing brand, but gymsharks use of  marketing and conscious focus on their ‚Äòculture‚Äô has in fact earnt them a cult following.\nwhile getting people into the gym is a positive thing, many have criticised gymshark for promoting and sponsoring disingenuous influencers secretly take ped‚Äôs all the while claiming natural to sell their programs and supplements to na√Øve teenagers who hero-worship influencers.\n of the biggest things which puts people off going to the gym is unrealistic expectations and fake naturals are only making this problem worse.\namongst this advice being given out by gymshark athletes are glaring pieces of misinformation which could have very negative effects on their audience‚Äôs .\nwhile most of these instances are just honest mistakes and the  truly does want the best for their audience because effective advice is often boring, many of these ‚Äôs resort to party tricks and the invention of their own ridiculous exercises to stand out from the crowd.\nmisinformation and dishonesty are  of the main things which the gymshark founder‚Äôs initial fitness inspirations (scott herman and scooby1961) fought against, and gymsharks association with those who spread misinformation has resulted in the company losing  of their best most transparent science-based influencers; natacha oceane.\nso, i believe that this is something that gymshark are going to start taking more seriously.\n\nmoreover, now that gymshark are a global billion-dollar brand for them to expand they cannot focus purely on sponsoring those with often unnaturally achievable physiques, after all aesthetics is  of many reasons to go to the gym. if gymshark do start posting photos of people who aren‚Äôt diced to the socks, i really don‚Äôt think this is a bad thing. if the person is actively trying to improve, many people are likely to find this more relatable which may as a result encourage them to get to the gym.\n\nafter watching every single  of ben francis, i can say that  of his main philosophies is to not fear failure/mistakes, he views them as a good thing as they cannot be avoided (especially when running an innovative company), after all it is from responding to and addressing mistakes and failure that the business has been able to scale so fast.\nben remains the major shareholder and from the companies‚Äô recent actions, it does seem  they are making changes for the better.\n---------------------------------------\n‚ñ∫ùòæùôßùôöùôôùôûùô©ùô®\nben francis

from amazon, and if you are a student/ someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on equipment i would suggest the same.\n\nhowever if you are committed to neck training for the long run and have the money i would definitely consider the neck flex (used by jeff nippard, alphadestiny and the ufc). after upgrading i have to say it is much more sturdy, comfortable and allows you to train lateral flexion which i couldn't really do before.\n\nneck flex :\n://bit.ly/3h0czjk\n\n\nùóûùó≤ùòÜ ùóßùóÆùó∏ùó≤ùóÆùòÑùóÆùòÜùòÄ\n- neck training is underrated.\n- training everyday is overkill and not optimal.\n- do not copy me,  jeff nippard, alpha destiny and the bioneer.\n- cross reference all info you receive.\n- read atomic habits if you are looking to strengthen habits.\n- if untrained you can make noticeable neck progress in just 100 .\n\n\ni also think its very important to point out the 'before' photo had awful lighting, hence why i tried to recreate it in the final before and after photo, the truth is even though 1.25 inches is significant growth in only 100 , in bad lighting it isn't as noticeable.\n\nsecondly, while an interesting experiment and something i wanted to try out of pure curiosity (gonna say it again) i do not recommend training neck everyday, as mentioned in the  only 3-4 neck  a week were done with a higher intensity, however since i have moved to 3  a week and progress has been much steadier.\n\ni strongly recommend prioritisation of an effective warmup and higher rep sets as neck strains are not fun at all. moreover i recommend filming yourself on your  few sets as this will allow you to spot hyperextension (as i did)/ allow you to identify and correct poor form.\n---------------------------------------

culture.\n\nhave you noticed how  has become dominated by so called influencers?\n\nnow there are many benefits to following these extremely popular figures, you get  advice, product recommendations and also get to feel part of a community all striving towards a similar goal.\nand in return for the value provided, they are rewarded lavishly, without the need for a single qualification. \nyou have people giving advice which is not at all backed by science. medical science isn‚Äôt the only way to cure something.\nwith great power comes great responsibility and a lot of these people are just not ready or prepared for such a thing. \n\nand the consequences are devastating...\n\nnote\ni am a fairly new creator who is still finding their own style this  was heavily inspired by:\njake tran\njames jani\nlemmino \nvox \nvice\nthe social dilemma\nas time progresses i will differentiate further and further :) \n\npart 1: unregulated advice \nfrom the fitness programs to supplement recommendations, most of which is shared and promoted in mainstream fitness is mostly unregulated.\nthis complete lack of regulation is why so many people are following misguided advice which is often extremely dangerous. \nand with the way in which  works, this is only becoming more and more problematic as we have our cognitive heuristics exploited.\n\n\npart 2:   reality\nmost of that which you are shown on  is only exists in a hyper-reality.\ntrying to compare yourself with this illusion you are being shown can be extremely detrimental to your mental and physical .\n\n\npart 3: fitness cults\nthe ideal image which the fitness industry projects is clear.\nand it can be truly enjoyable to aspire to reach these body standards. unfortunately, these standards are only getting more and more extreme which creates a breeding ground for eating disorders, cult  diet groups, fitness groups and online communities.\nwhile being a member in some of these groups can be beneficial/ enjoyable, thanks to the previous mentioned problems, when being a member of these groups becomes part of your identity, you are susceptible to the traps which lie and wait.\n\n\nfinal message\nmaintain balance when it comes to  and fitness.\nonly  science-based advice.\nonly compare yourself with yourself.\n\"have more than you show, say less than you know.\"\n\n\nùêíùêÆùê©ùê©ùê®ùê´ùê≠ ùêìùê°ùêû

opinions and observations on how society functions on a monetary level. of , the subjects of money, and entrepreneurship are far too vast to cover in a single  , so i have tried to condense this information as best as i can. enjoy \n\nthe myths about money\neveryone wants to know how to be rich, but when it comes to wealthy people the media and hollywood have a habit of depicting them as cruel, evil, corrupt, or backstabbing individuals.\nbut the real question is whether you believe this stereotype.\n\nmost of what you think about money has been influenced by your upbringing and surroundings. if you grew up poor, then you‚Äôre more inclined to believe that your financial future will remain under such circumstances. or perhaps you decided to make it your goal to generate as much wealth as possible so you will never grow up in those conditions again ‚Äì either way, it‚Äôs important to note that we may have false beliefs about money which will not serve you well if your goal is to become rich.\n\nthe equation to wealth.\nin a capitalist society, you are paid in proportion to the perceived value that you have. \n\nthis is very important to understand and can explain many reasons as for why people are paid differently. the cleaner is paid less than the accountant because the cleaner‚Äôs job is not difficult to learn, and they can easily be replaced. the accountant on the other hand has spent years studying numbers, and has saved their clients thousands on taxes. the market perceives the value of the accountant to be higher, and therefore the accountant makes substantially more money. \n\nand yet the problem with a job is that your income is time-bound. it requires your time to generate wealth, and only at an old age can you truly reap the rewards of the wealth that you‚Äôve built ‚Äì if you‚Äôve built any at all. \n\nhow then are there millionaires or billionaires at such young ages? what is it about people  elon musk, or jeff bezos that make their perceived value so high?\n\nthe next part of this equation is as follows: if you want money, you must solve problems. \n\nall money runs from this basic premise. if it solves a problem (depending on what the problem is), money will be thrown at it. \n\nif it‚Äôs a million-dollar problem, then the solution will make you millions. \n\nif it‚Äôs a billion-dollar problem, then the solution will make you billions. \n\ntruth is: if you‚Äôve been chasing money, then you‚Äôve been doing it all wrong. you need to chase problems, and more importantly, solutions to those problems.\n\n******\nall

program, or something of that nature. \n\na real rat race isn‚Äôt about working a 9-5 job, it‚Äôs about living on a financial edge. such that your greater  goals and ambitions are placed in the background as you continue chasing the next paycheck, or material possession. \n\nour relationship seems with money is often as follows: it enters our , and it leaves. sometimes this is expressed as your income and expenses, but i think a better way of framing this is your production  your consumption. \n\nfor most of us, we have an issue with consumption. and when fixing this, it may be best to  draw an awareness to yourself as a consumer. using a budget and tracking your expense is the best way of starting. a common strategy in personal finance is building an ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù, a fund that holds 3 ‚Äì 6 months‚Äô worth of expenses ‚Äì enough so that if an emergency were to ever occur, you wouldn‚Äôt have a problem financially supporting yourself through such an occasion. \n\nproduction is then about increasing the amount of value you can bring to a society. in my  the untold truth about money i mentioned that people are paid in proportion to their perceived value in the marketplace, and  of the best ways of increasing your perceived value is by solving a problem in the market, then selling this solution through a business at scale. this is the entrepreneurial route. and whilst most of us will be able to produce value into the market by selling our labour in the form of a 9-5 job, this doesn‚Äôt mean our ability to produce stops there. \n\n channels  graham stephan, or dave ramsey are great for learning about personal finance, and reducing your expenses. but these people don‚Äôt rely on cutting coupons/living frugally to be making millions. they are utilising a means of production at mass scale. graham stephan uses  as a vehicle to produce finance  at mass scale. \n\nattempt to identify ways in which you can produce value to the market. for example, i utilised my skills in acting, storytelling,  editing, and presenting, to create   the  on my . i saw  as a vehicle to be able to produce value to the market at scale. \n\n\n******\nall

workforce of people sometimes called their ‚Äúdistributors‚Äù. this strategy is also often labelled as network marketing. \n\nexamples of these companies are: herbalife, amway, acn, younique, lularoe, arbonne, beachbody, doterra, mary kay, nu skin, etc. \n\nalthough it seems ordinary on the surface, many of these companies have received a great amount of backlash, with entire communities built to

the shady practices some mlm companies use in order to keep their distributors inside the company. \n\nsome of these practices include the selling of a ‚Äúdream‚Äù and promises of high returns, wealth, residual income, or ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù if they join, whilst simultaneously promoting many self-help concepts. \n\nwe also take a look at what exactly a pyramid scheme is, how to spot ,

time. \n\nbut the  that lies behind \"the secret\" is  that has its roots all the way back to the 1800s, where the new thought movement began taking strides, as well as other new age beliefs. \n\nin this , we take a dive into that , and the sinister industry that his been built up around it. we'll take a look at some of the most influential figures in new thought throughout the past, to present . figures  napoleon hill (author of \"think and grow rich\", and \"the law of success\"), esther/abraham hicks (author of \"the law of attraction\" and various other works), bob proctor, rhonda byrne, and others. \n\nwe will also identify just how  new age spirituality has allowed itself to become a perfect grift, for gurus with questionable intentions to enter the space and take advantage of those in a more vulnerable and desperate situation. those who are in desperate need of wealth, those who are in desperate need for relationships, , happiness, etc etc. \n\nnew age/new thought exists in many areas of the self-help industry too, and although hard to initially spot, once someone familiarises themselves with the teachings of new thought and the overall philosophy it isn't hard to begin seeing the patterns. \n\nwe will also explore the connections between new age gurus and multi level marketing companies. a connection that seems very prevalent within many of the big figures in this industry. \n\n\n******\nall materials in these  are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use. no copyright infringement is intended. if you are or represent the

rise of new age spirituality. \n\nbut with rhonda byrne‚Äôs film, ‚Äúthe secret‚Äù that was promoted extensively by oprah winfrey, the law of attraction has reached whole new heights of popularity. this in addition to the continuous popularity and sales of napoleon hill‚Äôs ‚Äúthink and grow rich‚Äù, have created a large following of believers in the law of attraction and the idea that our

money flows. because make no mistake: this is no small business. individuals  rhonda byrne, esther hicks, napoleon hill, have made millions from promoting this ideology. but how trustworthy are these

months in a row (although sometimes this definition varies depending on who you ask). \nwith that being said, there are some important rules to keep in mind if you want to profit from a recession. the  rule being: nobody can time the market. no matter what, nobody knows when is the next recession. \n\nbut once a recession does hit, it‚Äôs important to not panic and start selling all your assets, because  thing is for sure: the market will always bounce back. but since the market is always shrinking and expanding, that also means that the market will always eventually crash. \n\nhow to prepare for a recession‚Ä¶\npreparing for a recession is perhaps the most important part of this whole game. it‚Äôs very important that you start to save up money, build capital, avoid debt, and build a healthy credit score. you want to make sure that you have all the resources ready to make the most from that economic collapse. there‚Äôs nothing worse than seeing so many opportunities in-front of you, but no ways to take advantage of them.\n\nwhat happens during a market crash?\nwhen an economies market crashes (for whatever reason)  can expect an increase in unemployment levels, business bankruptcy, and three very important things to rise: death, divorce, defaults. \n\nhow to invest during a recession?\nwhen the market crashes, people become desperate to sell their assets  shares, and real estate. and the more motivated someone is to sell something, the likelier they are to sell it for cheaper. \n\nthat‚Äôs where you come in. \n\nif you‚Äôve prepared for the recession properly, then you should have a good amount of capital saved up and ready to invest back into the economy. why invest back into the economy? remember: the market will always bounce back. and everything is on a discount during a recession. that means you get to  assets for way below market value, and then sell those very assets once the market bounces right back up ‚Äì which it always will.\n\n******\nall

: @jamesvjani // ://bit.ly/2zyprst\n\n\n******\n\nare student loans worth it?\ni don‚Äôt think student debt should be a major concern ‚Äì at least not if you are in england. here‚Äôs how student loans work in england: you begin by choosing your repayment plan. plans 1 & 2 will only have you paying 9% of your income that goes above the threshold (¬£25.72k) every month. the threshold is the amount of money you are expected to earn a year before you start paying back student loans. on an income of ¬£40k you will only be repaying ¬£1,285 a year. it‚Äôs not a lot, and it all gets written off after 30 years anyway. so what‚Äôs my biggest concern with going to university‚Ä¶? \n\nwhat degree should i do?\nchoosing your degree is the most important factor in this debate. there are so many people that will choose a degree because of parental pressure, societal pressure, or pressure from their friends. they will choose a degree because it looked ‚Äúfun‚Äù, or it seemed ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù, but a lot of people do not ask themselves: what career do i want to get into? and even more importantly: do i need this degree to get into a career?\n\nshould you take a gap year?\n of my biggest solutions to not knowing whether or not you should go to university, and what degree you should pick is taking a gap year. i know it works slightly different in the us, but in england you are given the choice to take a year off after sixth form (otherwise known as a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù). take it.\n\nwhat should i do in a gap year?\na few of my recommendations are reading, getting a job, going to networking events, and travelling. generally, you want to experiment and try different things. it‚Äôs important to see what you enjoy and are more inclined towards, which can aid you in making a decision on what career you want to get into. once you know what career you would  to go down, check to see if you need a degree to start working in that field. if you don‚Äôt, then it may be that going to university is not needed for you to get a job.\n\nwhat is the value of a degree?\ngrade inflation is a big problem that universities are tying to tackle. more than half of university students are leaving with a , or a 2:1. to add to that, the student cap that once prevented universities from letting in as many students as they liked has now been removed. removing the student cap has increased competition between universities, and now it‚Äôs become a major competition to get as many students in as possible. \nthis all becomes problematic when you look at how employable a degree makes you. the more graduates with top classifications there are, the less an employer can differentiate between who is truly the best, and who is not. my personal  is that a degree can get you a foot in the door for a job, but that is as far as it goes. the rest is up to how you perform in the interview.\ni would even go as far as to say that some employers (depending on the career) prefer non-graduates, so that they are coming into the company with a ‚Äòclean slate‚Äô and can be moulded through the company and not already enter the job with pre‚Äîconceived ideas and notions on how that company may or may not function.\n\n\n******\nall materials in these  are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use. no copyright infringement is intended. if you are or represent the

away from the insane story of :\n\nkevin systrom.\nkevin systrom ( of the founders who created ) was born on the 30th december 1983. as a child he worked at a vinyl record store, and was a big fan of the game doom ii (he was also an avid book reader, and still is to this !). from doom 2, kevin found a love for computer programming. \n\nduring his time at stanford, he briefly met with mike krieger where they spoke about his experience on the mayfield fellows program. whilst on the program kevin had worked at a tech company called odeo, a company that later went on to become . you can find a lot of this information scattered throughout kevin systrom and mike krieger interviews.\n\na meeting with mike krieger.\nafter finishing college and working for a few years at several companies, kevin has a meeting with mike krieger (who was also in the area) at a caf√©. in that caf√© they discuss the ideas for creating their  ever app. but it wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶\n\nburbn.\nburbn was a check-in app, much  foursquare. this was the original idea that kevin and mike came up with before creating . \nburbn received a large sum of capital from investors  steve anderson, and the venture capitalist company called andreessen horowitz. in total kevin systrom and mike kreiger had raised half a million dollars towards burbn. but no matter how much investors throw at your company, it won‚Äôt change the fact that the market may still not  your product or service.\nthe sad truth was that burbn was not getting much attraction. mike and kevin recognised this and realised they needed to change ideas.\n\nthe pivot.\nthe lean startup by eric reiss popularised the term ‚Äòpivoting‚Äô for startups, and this is exactly what mike & kevin did with burbn. they realised that most of their customers were interested in the photo sharing aspects of their app, and had little to no interest in the check in features. so they stripped away all of that stuff, and created an app that was all about photo sharing ‚Äì some may have called this their minimum viable product (another popularised startup term from eric reiss‚Äô the lean startup).\n\n.\nkevin systrom also went on a vacation around this time with his (now) wife nicole systrom. on that vacation nicole told him that she would likely not use the app because she didn‚Äôt think she could take good enough photos. kevin saw that she was trying to compare her own photo-taking abilities to her friends who would use filters on their photos. kevin identified a problem immediately, and created the  ever filter on  the x  ii. \nyou can still find the  ever photo on  to this  on kevin systrom‚Äôs official  account. \n\nselling for  billion.\n was sold to  for 1 billion dollars. the company is now valued at around 100 billion, and it can be argued that kevin and mike‚Äôs decision to sell  was a clever  at the end of the , allowing their company to grow at the hands of mark zuckerberg. \n\n\n******\nall materials in these  are used for

popular streamer on the twitch platform, and a player of the popular online  game league of legends (created by the company riot games). \n\nothers may know him from the various \"rage compilation\" and \"meme compilation\"  of him spread out across  and other platforms that have garnered millions of views. \n\nbut before tyler1's brand became as established as it is today, and before tyler1 was known for his entertainment, he was initially classed as \"the most toxic league of legends player in north america\". people only recognised tyler for his toxic behaviour in the league of legends community.\n\ntyler1's story was something quite surreal to have witnessed, especially for those who had  seen his rise to fame initially through disco heat's  on tyler1.\n\ndisco heat's  had propelled tyler1's audience into the thousands. it also highlighted his toxic behaviour in the game, and spawned copycats that would mimic tyler1's attitude and behaviour whilst playing league of legends.  \n\nwhat ensued afterwards was a rare \"indefinite ban\" punishment by riot games, and a battle between tyler1 as a brand and riot games as a company. \n\nthis brought tyler1's brand to a standstill and an all important realisation: that if tyler1 was to maintain his audience and streaming career, he would have to be known for something other than his toxic behaviour. he would have to create a \"redemption arc\" for his brand, and eclipse the negative associations of his current brand. \n\nwhat followed was a  of entertaining and special events throughout tyler1's streaming career that allowed him to craft memorable moments that would define his brand amongst the streaming community of twitch. \n\ntyler1‚Äôs story and journey as a brand displayed how a personal brand is built on a persons‚Äô experience of you. change their experience and you change the brand. it isn‚Äôt about the followers, nor is it about exposure. your brand is built from the moment you interact with someone else.\n\n\n\n******\nall materials in these  are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use. no copyright infringement is intended. if you are or represent the

also given up on any other challenge run i was doing for now, got too exhausting..  and i needed to beat my 2:25 any% unm time i did 3 months ago with 100%.  2:20 is definitely possible, the real dream though is to see someone do  2:17:11, which is byteme's record time for doom 2016, as eternal being faster than doom 2016 would be quite , getting close.\n\n100% is all weapons upgraded, get all

current patch even if it's slower when the game is no longer being updated, as running on some intermidiate patch that's not the fastest is rather pointless, but i feel a category  100% should be run on the latest patch. with version 1.2 there is a lot of time loss since the marauder ice bomb glitch is fixed, probably adds up to a couple of minutes at least.  can only hope they decide to allow us to skip the battery insertion animation in the fortress and thus make it a faster version  .\n\nmy last 3 attempts: \n1: just as the icon of sin death cutscene was playing i thought \"alright, now to check... fuck, didn't i forget that elena log?\", yes.. yes i did.\n2: \"alright, the time is shit, but just kill the icon of sin and be done with it\" i destroy 7 out of 8 body parts in the  phase and get killed by a lost soul about a meter away from the soulsphere.\n3: this .\n\nwhen i started these last attempts i did have a few resets on hell on earth though, forgot an item on dhb and died once on arc complex as well, but otherwise my consistency is really good at the moment. here slayer gate 3 should have been my  death on super gore nest though, had a close call at the start of arc complex too. the 2 failed attempts i had before this  were between 2:28-2:29 rta, so this was over 3 minutes faster (even with a crash), so that's nice.\n\nsome changes i've come up with or adjustments:\n- fast  on arc complex, skips the turret elevators.\n- fast  on urdak, skip the 30 seconds cutscene for the  ring + some smaller sections by the  secret encounter. also use of bfg to clear out the  fight instead of the  secret encounter.\n- included use of the destroyer blade, because it's really good. \n- switched back to heat blast upgrades  since i can't be bothered to headshot stuff anymore. \nand a lot of other smaller things.\n\na few comments about the run:\nslayer gate 1 was bad, gate 3 was abysmal, but gate 5 went well for once.\ni think i lost the most time on arc complex.\ndisappointed i failed the meathook skip at mars core for the  time.\ntaras nabad has a visual glitch if you go too far above the map by the  pain elemental.\nhad to take a moment to think about which side i'm supposed to glory kill on nekravol after failing the  .\nhad a small skip in mind after the tyrant arena on final sin, but i failed it twice.\ni think i got every single marauder kill rather quickly.\nthat cutscene after the  baron on urdak, no idea what was up with that... lol. \n\nthanks for watching.","publishedAt":"2020-07-17T15:38:51.000Z","title":"Doom Eternal - 100%

that.  \n- again i had a glitch with the visuals on taras nabad when i glory killed the  pain elemental, happens because i go too far above the map.\n\nthanks for

below, the  part starts at 17:16.\n\nthis is the  true uv-max completion of this level, where 100% kills and 100% secrets (0 out of 0 in this case) is achieved. the issue with maxing this level is that even with really good infighting and perfect ammo management you are left with roughly 800 cyberdemons at 4000  each and nothing besides your fists, which deals 2-20 damage per hit, to kill them with.\n\nthe monsters can do some damage to the cyberdemons through infighting, most notably the arch-viles, but eventually they get destroyed by the splash damage.\n\nany monster on the upper area that attacks the cyberdemons are also quickly killed off, so there is only  solution: gather up enough homing revenant rockets to tear through all the cyberdemons. so how many do we need exactly? 850 cyberdemon at 4000  where revenants rockets do an average of 45 damage, that means we need to simply gather up at least 70000 rockets, great! ... there's just  more problem, while this is an incredibly easy task to do, it should take roughly 5  of circling revenants before you've got enough. \n\n5  isn't too bad, sure, but that's in game time, unfortunately the game runs a bit slower once the rockets start to pile up... to the point where you are moving 0.5 seconds every minute!\n\nso in real time it takes about 23  to gather the rockets, which would be extremely boring to do. luckily the upper area is really large, so what i did was take a segment where i circle the area, copy the inputs and insert them multiple  into the demo so that it's nearly 6  long and then simply let my laptop play through the demo for 23  before i then take control! so nobody, including myself, have actually seen what happens between 30 minutes and 340 minutes.\n\nthen of  the fun part begins, where you are moving 4 frames every 14 seconds to guide the rockets to the cyberdemons. there's a few places where i do some weird things  take damage for no reason, which is because of just horrible controls (i can't even move backwards) and doing it over again takes at least 30 minutes, so i left it  that. i would have tried to make it a bit better looking, but putting in effort to do that would have driven me mad, so it'll have to do. it took roughly 20  to do 10 minutes, needless to say that is just an awful experience. then there was another 25  or so of waiting to create the .\n\nat the start you have to help the revenants out by killing the barons, as the barons would win easily. the part between roughly 14:55 to 16:10 is repeated/copied until i have enough projectiles.\n\nthis can be done non-tas, you just need an actual super computer optimized to play doom and about 6 .\n\nwhat an absolute waste of my time this has been, hopefully you'll enjoy this more than i did.","publishedAt":"2021-07-28T13:02:17.000Z","title":"Doom II: Nuts 100% Kills - 85 Revenants vs 850 Cyberdemons

and give some insight on the routing, weapon choices etc. found here: ://pastebin./mwgjefex \n\ncomments about the run and route:\ni messed up about half the marauder fights really bad. probably easily lost 2 minutes on those. also didn't realize i wasn't using equipment fiend since arc complex until urdak.\n\ni used to upgrade the plasma rifle heat blast since it's rather easy, but the mastery (and weapon) is mostly useless once you get the ballista. that was pretty dumb since the precision bolt is pretty good and even without trying you'd end up upgrading it through the run. unfortunately my aim was rather shit and i missed a lot of simple shots wasting a bit of time. \n\npretty close to dying on the  slayer gate, got a little bit too close to the mancubus. \n\ni messed up the sentinel prime fight badly, you can kill the 1st phase very quickly, but i forgot i had to wait for him to attack on my 2nd ballista shot. once he is staggered fire 2 grenades and 3x3 rockets on him from behind when he leaves the stagger state, then meat hook on a demon he spawns and fire bfg from above to finish him. the 2nd phase was also really bad, should have used more ssg+ballista.\n\nfast  on taras nabad to clear out slayer gate with bfg and crucible and get a token. also skip 3 acid gates by shooting them through the wall.\n\ntaras nabad arch-vile screwed me over good, not only did he manage to spawn in the monsters when he was dead, he also spawned in a marauder. i've never seen this before so i didn't really know what would happen or what i should do.. so i figured i'd just fail the secret encounter, continue the level, and then come back with fast  and everything should be gone...... of  everything was still there and not being in the mood to deal with such bullshit i decided to use a bfg that i was planning to use on the prowler part of the slayer gate. anyways the idea here was pretty simple, get the secret encounter and bfg everything at the same time, then just kill the doom hunter. lost about 3 minutes and 30 seconds on this level so my time is easily improveable.\n\nforgot to grab a crucible at the end of taras nabad as well, so i kill the  tyrant on final sin without it.\n\nnew nekravol skip at the end, sometimes you can even kill a doomhunter by having it fall into the exit.also forgot a crucible at the end of nekravol, if i didn't forget both crucibles i would have used  on the other doom hunter here as well.\n\nforgot a bfg cell on nekravol ii, so i decided to clear out the  bfg cell area on final sin instead of using a bfg there. \n\na couple of urdak skips, the  being the spawns in the marauder area by jumping through the gate and falling down. the  being the arch-vile arena, there's 2 phases to it and i just jump around the arena twice and come back to it at the end and get the weapon point. i messed up the double baron fight badly, partially because of bad ammo management prior to the fight, you can kill almost everything quickly here.\n\n+ some other misc skips on cultist base and super gore nest.\n\nthis was played on the old patch. without dumb mistakes etc.  2:40 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nthanks

unavoidable damaging floors.\ntas: tool-assisted speedrun\n\nsomething a little bit out of the ordinary from me, but not quite brutal doom levels of weird. creating a demo  this was basically impossible with the previous tools available, because frequent use of segmenting is necessary, and for long levels with a lot of monsters the load  get extremely tedious. however, recent improvements to segmenting has made stupid things  this possible.\n\ni took damage at 2 points from damaging floors,  at 46:27, maybe i could have avoided it with some perfect timing, doesn't matter as there's another point at 1:42:25 where there's absolutely no way to avoid the damage. obviously no iddqd cheat is used, whenever i got hit i would simply re do it until i didn't get hit.\n\nnightmare is probably impossible with tas, i don't think there's a possibility to get past the hell knights at 1:50:00 because of respawn. this map uses -complevel 9 or boom, which has a different respawn mechanic, in vanilla a monster will not respawn if it's starting place is blocked by another monster. in boom however the monster can spawn on top of another monster causing them both to get stuck. so you have a massive wall of  you need to get through both ways with no way to move around it.

rewind back a  - try something else - make progress or repeat until progress is made. \n\nwhy didn't the hit register??: sprite size does not equal hitbox. mancubus projectiles are much larger than their hitbox, so even if it looks  i should have gotten hit then that doesn't make it so.\n\nclaiming someone is cheating in a tas is incredibly dumb, a tas would be a cheated run if there is no mention of tas being used. so tas is using features that would otherwise be considered cheating, so essentially it's  saying: \"you're cheating in this run which you are saying is intentionally cheated\". however it's is and has always been clearly labelled as a tas, it would actually take a lot more effort to cheat by  editing or modifying the game etc.","publishedAt":"2021-03-04T19:25:24.000Z","title":"Doom II: Okuplok Slaughter Map UV-Fast No Hit Run in 2:45:20 [TAS]","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCiVZWY9LmrJFOg3hWGjyBbw","videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Zero Master","tags":["Doom","Slaughter","UV Max","100%","All Kills","Fast","Speedrun","Okuplok","No Hit","Damageless","No Damage"],"liked":false},"e4QrZJzg4rg":{"description":"taras nabad is a new official master level, here's my  unm clear.\n\nthat could have gone better.  attempt as i got cornered  an idiot down in the sewers on my  attempt. this attempt wasn't pretty, had to resort to a bfg on the double arch-vile encounter in the sewer and crucible on the triple tyrants as i was quite sure i was too low on ammo, and on my nightmare playthrough i barely had enough and i saw no fodder, so i decided to just slice them down. \n\nthe timing of the release could not have been worse, the sun is directly in my window + i was watching uefa euro 2020 at the same time, so all mistakes i made i blame on that :)\n\ndefinitely the most difficult official doom eternal content yet imo. i was hoping there wouldn't be too much of the smoke filled rooms  in super gore nest, thankfully it was restricted to some parts of the arenas which was much better.\n\nenjoy!","publishedAt":"2021-06-29T22:40:32.000Z","title":"Doom Eternal: Taras Nabad Master Level Ultra-Nightmare [No Hud]","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCiVZWY9LmrJFOg3hWGjyBbw","videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Zero Master","tags":["Doom Eternal","Ultra Nightmare","Master Level","Taras Nabad"],"liked":false},"mZVweuiOGVs":{"description":"mars core is 1 of 2 new official master levels, this is my  unm clear.\n\n2 areas that i was mostly scared of here, the section immediately after getting the bfg and the smoke filled room. i think i got myself trapped there at  point in both areas so i was kind of lucky to make it out alive. \n\nhad some ammo trouble with the cyber mancs at the very end in my nightmare playthrough, so i decided to just bfg that section once instead of getting myself killed.\n\nenjoy!","publishedAt":"2021-10-26T22:31:08.000Z","title":"Doom Eternal: Mars Core Master Level Ultra-Nightmare [No Hud]","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCiVZWY9LmrJFOg3hWGjyBbw","videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Zero Master","tags":["Doom Eternal","Ultra Nightmare","Nightmare","Master Level","No HUD"],"liked":false},"QGv-mVVrihQ":{"description":"1440p/2160p  here: ://youtu.be/ihow8uishok \n\nyes, it's only nightmare, but it's deathless so i'll go with the fake clickbait title. deathless  playthrough is better anyways, as a  playthrough would be trivial, because this was quite easy to begin with.\n\ntimestamps:\nthe world spear ( level): 2:36\nhammer time: 16:10\ncutscene: 21:20\ngame crashed: 24:58 -

50% charge - 55% charge, do 2nd dash - 0% charge. 5% is wasted (no idea about the exact number). while if you time your dash perfectly when you hit 100% charge you don't waste any time, though i haven't quite got the hang of it yet and it might not make that much of a difference.\n\ni switched around some keybinds, most notable i switched use/glory kill to mouse wheel down and grenade to e. i finally found keybinds i am overall comfortable with, there was just always something that didn't quite feel right, but now it's all good. i'll leave a list at the bottom of the description.\n\nthanks for watching.\n\nkeybinds:\nw,a,s,d -

19:43\n\ndescription:\n  20 minute run for ultimate doom on ultra-violence!\n\ni can't believe it's been nearly 1.5 years since i did the 20m06s and just left it there. was about time i bothered to finish this. saving/loading is allowed for real-time attack (rta), though i never died so loading wasn't necessary, thus i get a single segment deathless run as well which is nice. in-game time (igt) is not used since it's not possible to record all 4 episodes in a single demo.\n\nthe reason why it's taken so long for me to do this is because it's a rather unforgiving run with episode 4 at the end so it's not very fun. i've seen other games with an episode format do them out of order, but that just ain't the right way to do it imo. it all comes down to the cyberdemon at the end of e4m6 if you haven't already lost too much time on e4m1 and e4m2, maybe if you have a good time you get a  chance, but usually the exact same thing happens and you die a few  and get 20:0x at the end.\n\nepisode 1: slow start, but went pretty ok otherwise. lost a few seconds on e1m5, but that's to be expected.\nepisode 2: failed the jump on e2m2, it's pretty easy so that's a bit disappointing. had a good e2m6 with the void glide and a decent switch press to make up for it.  try rocket jump on e2m7 too.\nepisode 3: this episode is quite easy, went ok. i grab some extra cells on e3m6 so that i can clear out the lost souls on e3m7 before the exit jump, because it frequently fails because of lost souls.\nepisode 4: took more damage than i would have liked before getting to the rocket launcher on e4m1, but then i took no damage at all so it went really well. e4m2 is always very scary, but nothing went wrong. cyberdemon didn't kill me immediately on e4m6 so that's as good as it gets. i wanted to load the quicksave just before the rocket jump on e4m8, but i went with it and i'm glad i did. was close at the end there.\n\nthanks for watching!","publishedAt":"2021-02-26T17:58:34.000Z","title":"Ultimate

very frequently used. i have to admit i wasn't paying any attention to what the hammer actually does in my  playthrough, so when i heard that it recharges by simply destroying 2 weak points i had to test it out. so i tried to use it as much as possible here.\n\ntimestamps:\nthe world spear ( level): 0:16\nescalation encounter 1: 16:30\nreclaimed earth ( level): 25:13\nescalation encounter 2: 30:00\nimmora ( level): 43:08\nescalation encounter 3: 44:00\nfinal boss: 1:00:08\n\n100% = doing the optional  phase escalation encounters and grabbing a couple of codexes. no monitor crosshair used, even though my aim somehow seemed to be better than in my previous playthrough.\n\nhad 2 close calls here, the  at the purple slime fountain, would be nice if i knew where the mancubus + screecher were going to jump in so i could avoid being on top of them all of the sudden. the  escalation encounter apparently nearly managed to kill me as well. \n\nalso i have to say, the sound effects when the various equipment is available are just the best, honestly besides a few points i'm not even at a disadvantage. still haven't quite got the hang of the different grenade switch sounds, i'm just never certain about which sound is which when i only use it once, only if i spam it do i know the difference.\n\nmy proudest moment was landing all 4 headshots on the blood makyrs at 22:45 without a crosshair and without missing once, and the  where i killed  through a tyrant corpse at 56:25\n\ni can understand why some find the final boss a bit annoying, at least during the 3rd and final phase. even though i felt  i knew exactly what to do it just takes too much time before he spawns the dogs, then he can  up with the demon spawns in which case you should use the hammer and wait for the dogs again (edit: actually you just need to glory kill 2 zombies instead of waiting for the dogs, this fight is ok once you know that, heh). it also seems nearly impossible to die if you just circle around killing zombies for armor. \n\nafter playing through it twice i really enjoyed it, sure, it's a bit easy, but if you make it as hard as plutonia on nightmare then i'll be the only  that still enjoys it :)\n\nfinally, i'm really afraid of the cursed prowlers, because i still haven't got hit by  and i don't know what it does, but it sounded pretty bad from the description. \n\ncutscenes and codexes text can be found in my previous / playthrough found here: ://youtu.be/qgv-mvvrihq\n\nthanks for watching.","publishedAt":"2021-03-19T21:22:19.000Z","title":"Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part Two

the arch-vile and chaingunner are alive when exiting the level. map 26 secret can be activated now, but it's still skipped because it's not trivial to do. map 11 arch-viles are nearly impossible to kill. so 100% can be achieved on all those levels, but speedruns are done without them as for example requiring 100% kills on map 11 is
